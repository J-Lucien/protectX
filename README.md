# Figma-Based HTML/CSS Practice Project

## Overview
This project is a practice exercise to enhance my HTML and CSS skills. The design is based on a Figma prototype, and the goal is to replicate the layout and styling as closely as possible.

## Features
- **SCSS for Styling:** SCSS is used to structure and manage the styling efficiently.
- **Clean HTML:** The HTML is structured to be semantic and easy to understand.
- **Work in Progress:** The project is still being developed, and full responsiveness across different screen sizes is yet to be implemented.
